\section{Related Work}
Previous work conducted by Chen et al.\cite{chen-2014} aimed at predicting the amount of forks for a given repository on GitHub.
Our approach was similar to their's, as they had divided their data into different strata in order to get a good sample space.
Furthermore, they also had multiple features to create a model to predict the amount of forks.
The results of their research indicated that they could accurately predict the amount of forks for repositories on GitHub and provided valuable insights on the potentials for predicting properties of a GitHub project.
