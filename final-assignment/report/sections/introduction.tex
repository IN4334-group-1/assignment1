\section{Introduction}
More and more people make use of GitHub\ref{TODO} to host their Open Source Software (OSS). \\
A way in which you can show your appreciation or interest in a project, is by `starring' it\ref{TODO} \\
Some projects get more stars than others, but is this only due to the idea behind the project or are more factors that have influence on the amount of stars? \\
This paper will be looking at the stars given to OSS projects and whether certain factors can have influence on the amount of stars a project can possibly get, and if there are key points to focus on when aiming at having the most stars as possible. \\

        \begin{itemize}
            \item What are stars?
            \item Why are stars cool?/what do they indicate?
            \item How is it possible to research them?
        \end{itemize}
