\section{Introduction}
    More and more people make use of GitHub to host their Open Source Software (OSS)\cite{github-2013}. 
    GitHub is not only a place were people share their software, it has also become a `social network' for software developers because of its social features. \cite{dabbish-2012} 
    One of those social features is `starring' a project. Users can show their appreciation for a project by giving it a  star. The amount of stars for a project thus gives an indication of how many people appreciate that project.
    
    However, there might be several factors that influence the amount of stars of a project. 
    One can think of the functionality that the project offers, but what about projects that offer more or less the same functionality but have a greatly different amount of stars? Other factors such as popularity of the topic of the project, it being easy to use, e.g. a library that can be added, and more can all have influence.
    
    This paper will be looking at the stars given to OSS projects and whether certain factors can have influence on the amount of stars a project can possibly get, and if there are key points to focus on when aiming at having the most stars as possible.
