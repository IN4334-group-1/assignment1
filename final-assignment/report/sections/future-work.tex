\section{Future Work}
Something that could be related to the amount of stars, that is not considered in this paper, is the documentation of a project.
When a project is documented well, or not documented at all, this might have an influence on the appreciation users show for that project.
The reason this was not considered in this paper, is because it is hard to measure documentations throughout different projects as some have extensive documentation on their own website, while they are not using the GitHub features for documenting the projected.
Furthermore, at the moment of writing it is not possible to check if a project has created a readme file or a wiki page in their repository, as the GHTorrent dataset does not include the files itself. For future research it might therefore be interesting to investigate this feature and include it in a prediction model.

    Another aspect that could be improved is the sampling of the projects. 
    Although we are confident that the approach using the different strata was solid, projects in our sample might share contributors. 
    This implies that it is possible that the different projects in the sample are not independent of each other.
    To further improve upon this research, it is important that the projects are fully independent.
