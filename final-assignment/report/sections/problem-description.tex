\section{Problem Description}
    Although the amount of stars for a project are far from the only indicator of a project's success, they give an indication of how many people actually like the project.
    For developers, it might be important to know how they can gain the appreciation of other GitHub users: the more people that use or collaborate to a project, the faster it will evolve.

    We will now further concretize the subject of this research. 
    The main research question is as follows: `Can we predict the amount of stars a project on GitHub will get when looking at its characteristics?'
    This high-level question can be split up into two more concrete questions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Which factors influence the popularity of a project?
        \item To what extent can we accurately predict the amount of stars on a project?
    \end{itemize}
    
    To answer these questions, a dataset which contains a lot of data concerning the projects on GitHub is needed. 
    This dataset is available: GHTorrent \cite{gousios-2013} is a dataset which is constantly mining the GitHub application for more data on projects, and contains all the data that we need for this research.
