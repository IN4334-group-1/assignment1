\section{Problem Description}
    We will now further concretize the subject of this research. 
    The main research question is as follows: `Can we predict the amount of stars a project on GitHub will get when looking at its characteristics?'
    This high-level question can be split up in several other questions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Which factors influence the popularity of a project?
        \item How can we explain the influence of those factors?
        \item \todo{To what extent of certainty can we predict the number of stars for a given project? - beetje vaag misshcien?} 
    \end{itemize}
    
    In order to answer these questions, a dataset which contains a lot of data concerning the projects on GitHub is needed. 
    This dataset is available: GHTorrent \cite{gousios-2013} is a dataset which is constantly mining the GitHub application for more data on projects, and contains all the data that we need for this research.


    \todo{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Our research questions
        \item a short introduction into the dataset of Gousios
    \end{itemize}
    }
