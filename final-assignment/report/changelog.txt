Changes since Version 1 of the report:

//Features
# A high level features has been renamed (Popularity  of developers or organisation -> Charactertistics of developer and organization)
# Number of commits has been removed as a subfeature, because the reasoning behind it wasn't sound.
# Number of releases and time between releases have been removed as subfeatures, since there was no data present in the GHTorrent dataset that we could use for this. Also we decided that domains can potentially have more influence and decided to focus on that.

//Research Questions
# One of the research questions has been removed and will now be considered as more of a discussion point for the first RQ.

//Data exploration
# New datasets have been created where we excluded big companies such as Microsoft, Google and Apple.
# Multiple new diagrams / plots made based on this data
# Some data has already been categorized in a specific domain, based on the ACM classification. This has also been explained further in the paper. 

//General
# More references have been added whenever something was stated.
# Spelling errors have been reduced
# Removed 'in order to' from multiple sentences
