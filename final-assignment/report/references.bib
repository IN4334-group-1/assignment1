  title="Statistically nonrepresentative stratified sampling: A sampling technique for qualitative studies",
  journal="Qualitative Sociology",
  volume="9",
  number="1",
  pages="54--57",
  year = "1986",
  abstract="When doing quantitative studies, we usually need a statistically representative sample. The same is often not the case with qualitative studies where we need a sample with variations along the independent variables. The technique described here is simple to use and guarantees variations. A statistically representative sample, on the other hand, if small, often gives few variations. Thus, one could say that the technique presented is a kind of statistically nonrepresentative stratified sampling useful in qualitative studies.",
